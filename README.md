# How to Speak Tensor

This corresponds to a talk I gave in
[International AMS-UMI Joint Meeting 2024](https://umi.dm.unibo.it/jm-umi-ams/special-sessions/special-sessions-on-25-26-july-2024/)
session [B28, Zullo, Algebraic Coding Theory](https://umi.dm.unibo.it/jm-umi-ams/index.php?gf-download=2024%2F06%2FFile-B-B28.pdf&form-id=4&field-id=9&hash=0cb37c575aeb1c7ff4d3bdfa36f6524732bfd11d45499562ab0a9fed8af839e4).

## Abstract

Tensor is an algebraic operation that combined a set of vector spaces into a big vector space.
It can be used to construct codes out of trivial codes.
In this talk, we will go over four creative applications:
distributed storage, distributed matrix multiplication, local testability, and quantum error correction.
